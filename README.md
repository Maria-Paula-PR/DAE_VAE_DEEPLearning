# Denoising & Variational Autoencoder for Fruits 🍍🍓

This repository contains a Denoising and Variational Autoencoder trained on images of pineapples and strawberries. The model is designed to remove noise from images while also learning a compact latent representation of the fruit dataset.

## Features:
- ✅ **Denoising Autoencoder (DAE)** – Removes noise and reconstructs clean fruit images.
- ✅ **Variational Autoencoder (VAE)** – Learns a meaningful latent space for generating new fruit images.
- ✅ **Preprocessing Pipeline** – Automatic resizing, normalization, and class balancing for improved training.
- ✅ **Gradio Interface** – Easily test the model by uploading images and visualizing the denoised results.

This project is useful for image denoising, feature extraction, and generative modeling in the context of fruit image datasets. 🚀

## Usage:
Simply upload a noisy pineapple or strawberry image, and the autoencoder will reconstruct a cleaner version!
